"""ClaudeState sealed union — the four-case classification of a running
Claude Code instance.

A running Claude Code process is always in exactly one of:

- ``Working`` — the input chrome is rendered and a spinner with ``…``
  is running above it. Carries the status text (e.g. ``Thinking… (3s)``).
- ``Idle`` — the input chrome is rendered, no spinner. Claude is waiting
  for the user's next message. Carries no payload.
- ``Blocked`` — the input chrome has been replaced by a blocking UI
  (permission prompt, AskUserQuestion, ExitPlanMode, Settings, etc.).
  Carries the matched ``BlockedUI`` variant and the extracted content.
- ``Dead`` — the host process is no longer alive. This package does NOT
  detect Dead from pane text alone (a pane can show a frozen final
  frame indistinguishable from Idle); callers must probe the host
  process separately and construct ``Dead()`` themselves.

Union is sealed: adding a fifth case requires editing every match site.
